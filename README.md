## Dice Roll(dice_roll.py):
Its basically prints the dice structure with zeros on it which represents dots of a dice. So on entering 'y' its print dice numbers randomly.

## Hangman(hangman.py):
It is based on that you were given the number of hyphens which represents the number of characters of a certain string which you were having to guess it correctly.
So on every right character entered it will be replaced by hyphen otherwise for every wrong input a structure get started builds up and for every further wrong input will add 
more pieces to it which may finally end up it with a complete structure which basically a Stickman hanging.
