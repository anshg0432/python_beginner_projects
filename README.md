## Dice Roll(dice_roll.py):
Its basically prints the dice structure with zeros on it which represents dots of a dice. So on entering 'y' its print dice numbers randomly.

## Hangman(hangman.py):
It is based on that idea that you were given number of hyphens which represents the number of characters of a certain string tby hen you will have to guess it corrctly.
So on every right character entered it will be replace by hyphen otherwise for every wrong input a structure get start builds up and for every further wrong inputs will add 
more pieces to it which may finally end up it with a complete structure which basically a stickman hanging.
